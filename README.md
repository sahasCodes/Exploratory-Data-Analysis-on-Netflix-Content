# Netflix Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview
This repository contains code for an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on Netflix data. The analysis explores various aspects of the dataset, including importing data, basic statistics, data cleaning, and visualization of Netflix content trends. The project aims to provide insights into the distribution of genres, top actors, and trends in the release of TV shows and movies on Netflix.

## Project Structre
* Netflix_eda.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for EDA.
* netflix_titles.csv: Dataset used for analysis.
* README.md: Documentation providing an overview of the project, instructions, and interpretations of visualizations.

## Getting Started
### Installation

git clone https://github.com/sahasCodes/Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Netflix-Content
```

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have this libraries are installed:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Code Overview
* Importing Libraries: Code to import necessary libraries.
* Importing Dataset: Code to import the Netflix dataset.
* Basic Statistics and Information: Displaying basic statistics and information about the dataset.
* Data Cleaning: Handling null values and renaming columns.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations of Netflix content trends.
* Question and Answer: Visualizations to answer specific questions about the data.
## Question Explored
